Parse out USMLE/COMLEX fails from PDF

## EXTRACT AAMC ERAS BOARD SCORES
This beta web app is intended for U.S. residency programs to quickly determine TOTAL FAIL attempts on either USMLE or COMLEX board examinations. Unfortunately, current ERAS only posts PASS board scores into the applicant's viewable profile dashboard as means to reduce any biases. It is up to the reviewer however to click on the applicant's files section to download and view further of any FAIL attempts that is not readily shown. This can be labarious and presents challenges to the program when applicant pools are in the thousands.

### What does the Web App do? 
- Allows residency programs to upload Board PDFs and receive CSV file output of Fails

### Is my data safe? 
- Yes, it is a front end web app without any server sided data collection.  Allows upload, parse, and download sequentially

### How is this Web App useful?
- Sole purpose is to reduce burden of manually counting from PDFs any Fail attempts by residency programs

### Is there a guarantee that the Web App is 100% accurate in parsing the PDFs? 
- No, the Web App is only a tool and it is up to the program/individual to cross check the CSV output for any inaccuracies

### Is this free? 
- Yes, no strings attached.  Developed by a physician involved in resident recruitment.  

### Will there be any updates?
- Based on changes in USMLE/COMLEX reporting PDF formats, parsing techniques will need to be adjusted.
